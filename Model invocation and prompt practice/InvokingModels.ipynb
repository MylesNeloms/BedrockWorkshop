      " General Relativity is a theory developed by Albert Einstein in 1915 that explains how gravity works. General Relativity is an explanation of gravity that is different from the way that gravity has been understood for thousands of years. For example, Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, which was developed in 1687, describes gravity as a force of attraction between two masses, like a ball on the earth or a moon around the earth. \n",

For example, according to Einstein, gravity is not a force, but rather a curvature of space and time.  This is a hard idea to explain, so let's talk about it in terms of a sheet. \n",
      "\n",
      "You are standing on a sheet. When you sleep, your body creates a small dent in the sheet. Your body is heavy and sinks into the sheet, causing a dent to form. If you make a small object that is very light, like a piece of paper, and you place it on the sheet, it will only sink a tiny bit into the sheet. If you make something very heavy, it will sink into the sheet a lot. \n",

      "Imagine that the sheet is space and the dents are where large objects, like the sun and the earth, are located. If you were a tiny object, like a planet, you would be curved into the dent created by the sun. This is similar to how planets orbit the sun. The curvature of space-time causes objects to move in certain ways, and this is how gravity works.\n",
      "\n",
      "General Relativity also explains things that Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation could not explain, like how fast time should pass on different planets, or how much a gravitational wave should stretch space-time. It is a very powerful theory that has been tested many times and has helped scientists understand many things about the universe.\n",
