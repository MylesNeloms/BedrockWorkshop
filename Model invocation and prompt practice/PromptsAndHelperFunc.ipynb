      "\n",
      "Paragraph 1:\n",
      "Chickens are birds, and they are not really built for swimming. Their bodies are covered in feathers, which are lightweight and help them fly, but they can get heavy and waterlogged when wet. Chickens also have small, scaly legs and feet, which are designed for walking and scratching the ground, not paddling through water. However, in some situations, chickens may find themselves in water and need to swim to safety.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paragraph 2:\n",
      "When a chicken ends up in water, it will use its wings to help it stay afloat and move forward. The chicken will flap its wings rapidly, creating a paddling motion that propels it through the water. Its feet will also kick and help with the swimming motion. Chickens can swim for short distances, but they quickly become tired and need to get out of the water. If they are in a pond or a shallow body of water, they may be able to walk or run along the bottom to get to the edge and climb out. Chickens are not very good swimmers, but they can manage to swim for a little while if they need to.\n"
